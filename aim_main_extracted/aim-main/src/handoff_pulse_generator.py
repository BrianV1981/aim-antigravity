You are waking up in the middle of a continuous operational loop.
To prevent hallucination, you must establish **Epistemic Certainty** regarding the previous agent's actions before you write any code.

### The Continuity Protocol (The Reincarnation Gameplan)
1. Read `continuity/REINCARNATION_GAMEPLAN.md` (The rigid executive directive passed by the previous agent).
2. Read `continuity/CURRENT_PULSE.md` (The explicit handoff state and project edge).
3. Read `ISSUE_TRACKER.md` (The local ledger of all open and closed tickets).
4. (Optional) Read `continuity/LAST_SESSION_FLIGHT_RECORDER.md` ONLY IF the Gameplan explicitly requires historical context extraction.
5. Do not blindly assume success. Verify the state via file reads or tests.
