# A.I.M. Roadmap: Project Singularity

## 🎯 The Ultimate Goal
Transform A.I.M. into a professional-grade, self-maintaining intelligence layer that scales to hundreds of sessions while ensuring absolute system safety and zero token waste via the **Zero-Token Continuity Model**.

## 🚨 ATTENTION ALL AGENTS (GITOPS MANDATE)
**DO NOT LOOK FOR TACTICAL TASKS IN THIS DOCUMENT.**

A.I.M. has officially transitioned to an **Issue-Driven Architecture** (Phase 40). We no longer use this markdown file to track individual checklists, as it is prone to state drift. 

To see your current tactical objectives, bugs, or feature assignments, you MUST query the GitHub Issue tracker:

```bash
gh issue list --state open
```

**The GitOps Bridge (Atomic Deployments):**
When executing a task from the issue tracker, you are strictly forbidden from executing raw `git commit` or `git push`. You must adhere to the 3-step loop:
1. **Report:** Use `aim bug "description"` to log a new issue (if not already listed).
2. **Isolate:** Use `aim fix <id>` to check out a unique, isolated branch for EVERY single task.
3. **Release:** Use `aim push "Prefix: msg"` to deploy atomically.

## 🗺️ High-Level Strategic Horizons
*(These represent the broad architectural milestones we are marching towards. Individual execution steps for these horizons are tracked as `enhancement` tickets in GitHub).*

### Horizon A: The P2P DataJack Swarm (Phase 38)
Transforming A.I.M. from an isolated local application into a decentralized network. The goal is to allow operators to frictionlessly share pre-compiled `.engram` databases (Cartridges) via a native background Python torrent engine, bypassing centralized cloud hosting.

### Horizon B: The Sovereign Comlink (Phase 39)
Untethering the Operator from the physical terminal. Building persistent bot daemons (Discord/Telegram) that allow full, two-way conversational interactions and remote shell execution directly from a mobile device.

### Horizon C: The Memory Brain Overhaul (Phase 32)
Transitioning the Cascading Memory System from "Full State Overwrites" to an "Event Sourcing / Delta Ledger" model. Instead of blindly rewriting `MEMORY.md`, the pipeline will generate explicit Delta Proposals for the Operator to merge.

### Horizon D: CLI Agnosticism (Phase 27)
Expanding the Exoskeleton's adapter layer to natively support and route through Anthropic's Claude Code CLI and the standard Ollama CLI, ensuring A.I.M. remains the universal brain regardless of the underlying execution interface.
